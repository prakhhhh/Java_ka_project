# Student Attendance & Performance Tracker - Java CLI

## Problem Statement

Managing student attendance and academic performance manually using registers or scattered spreadsheets is time-consuming and error-prone.
Teachers struggle to track attendance percentage, maintain consistent records, and quickly identify top-performing or at-risk students.

There is a need for a simple, offline, and easy-to-use tool that can store student details, attendance, and marks in one place and generate basic analytics.

## Scope of the Project

This project focuses on providing a **command line interface (CLI)**-based system for teachers to:

- Maintain student records
- Record attendance daily/weekly
- Store marks for assessments
- View basic analytics related to attendance and performance

The system uses **file-based storage** and is intended for small to medium-sized classes.

## Target Users

- College/School **teachers** who want a simple offline tool.
- **Class coordinators** who handle attendance and marks.
- Academic staff who need quick analytics without complex software.

## High-Level Features

1. **User Management**
   - Teacher registration and login with username & password.
